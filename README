# Connect 4 Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect 4 game using Python and Pygame. Connect 4 is a two-player connection board game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of your color.

## Features

- Play against another player or against an AI opponent.
- Adjustable difficulty level for the AI opponent.
- Colorful GUI with smooth animations.
- Ability to restart the game or quit at any time.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
3. Run the `connect4.py` file to start the game.
4. Choose whether you want to play against another player or against the AI.
5. If playing against the AI, select the difficulty level.
6. Click on the column where you want to drop your disc.
7. Try to form a line of four discs before your opponent does!
